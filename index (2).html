            <h1>The idea of our website is to present the student's math project in a different way</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to shed light on the relationship of modern teachnologies with mathematics</p>
            <h2 id="functions">Our life is a function</h2>
            <p>Many members of society have developed a perception that there is no significant benefit from mathematics curricula</br>
                However, mathematical functions enter most aspects of daily life without realizing it</br>
                This prompted the female students of King Abdulaziz University to organize an exhibition called “Our Life is Significant.”  Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Chair of the Mathematics Forum Committee at King Abdulaziz University, Dr. Salma Al-Tuwairqi, confirms that the distance function accompanies a person from the time he wakes up from sleep until he reaches any place throughout his day.  She believes that many people feel that mathematics has no applications in life other than simple operations, but this belief is wrong if most aspects of our lives are considered to discover that each aspect depends on a specific mathematical function</br>
                She pointed out that the exhibition “Our Life is a Sign” contains seven pillars that tell about the uses of mathematical functions in several fields, including health, social, technical and even imaginary</br>
                Indicating that 32 students from the Department of Mathematics prepared for this exhibition throughout the second semester.  She added: There were weekly meetings in which the students identified mathematical functions to collect information about them, and then ensure the validity of the scientific materials and their relevance to daily life and bring them closer to society through easy explanatory means</p>
